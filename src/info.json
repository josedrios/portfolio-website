  "aboutme": "My love for programming began in high school when I joined the Robotics Club, watching my peers turn pieces of metal into functioning robots through lines of code. This would lead me to start writing Java programs to help me solve my statistics and physics homework throughout high school and into college. Fast forward to now, I’m finishing up my CS degree at SFSU with several major projects under my belt and valuable insights gained from online coding courses. I’m excited for a full time career in programming.",

It works by reading the resource values from my phone screen, activating the servo which clicks the mouse to move to the next base through my Raspberry Pi or if a proper base is found that meets the players minimum loot threshold they will then be notified. This tool streamlines actions that would otherwise take hours, allowing players to focus on other activities instead of repeatedly pressing 'Next' to find the right base.",
