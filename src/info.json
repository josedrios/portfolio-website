By automating finding attackable bases, it helps players save time, letting users run this program while shifting their attention to anything else. Once a base is found that meets the players minimum loot threshold they will then be notified. This tool streamlines actions that would otherwise take hours, allowing players to focus on other activities instead of repeatedly pressing 'Next' to find the right base.",
